      <p>A benefit of neuroplasticity is that it gives people the knowledge that there is always a way to learn, and
        improve. A lot of people give up when confronted with a challenge or obstacle because they believe that their
        brain is hardwired a certain way, and that they won’t be able to find the solution without having been given
        assistance. However, neuroplasticity tells us that our minds are made to be reshaped, and to constantly learn
        and embrace new ways of thinking. This means that we are much more adaptable than most of us believe, allowing
        us to strengthen our brains physically and mentally, and make it much easier to face new challenges. We never
        stop learning, and we never stop evolving.</p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Discuss how you might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit
      </h2>
      <p>For my own benefit, repetition is a key principle that I will engage with. Repeating new skills and
        discussing them with others to get a better understanding is how I learn and retain information. I need to be
        physically using new skills to understand them, instead of just having things explained to me over and over.
        Also, being able to transfer skills to real life problems. Problem solving is such a crucial skill to have, and
        being able to adapt and tackle multiple problems is something I hope to gain from this.

      <h2 class="sub-heading">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
      <p>For myself, I am always wanting to learn a new skill. I’m in the process of learning a language, and in my
        free time trying to learn an instrument as well. I’m constantly engaging with new challenges both mental and
        physical by exercising a lot too, but these are both for fun and for improvement. I’m finding that balance of
        both working on myself and improving, while enjoying it at the same time, so I can feel like I am taking a break
        from feeling stressed. Also, I ensure I don’t push so hard that I’m exhausted and try to get plenty of rest when
        I can.</p>
