      <h2 class="sub-heading">How does understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefit people?</h2>
      <p>A benefit of neuroplasticity is that it gives people the knowledge that there is always a way to learn, and
        improve. A lot of people give up when confronted with a challenge or obstacle because they believe that their
        brain is hardwired a certain way, and that they won’t be able to find the solution without having been given
        assistance. However, neuroplasticity tells us that our minds are made to be reshaped, and to constantly learn
        and embrace new ways of thinking. This means that we are much more adaptable than most of us believe, allowing
        us to strengthen our brains physically and mentally, and make it much easier to face new challenges. We never
        stop learning, and we never stop evolving.</p>

    <div class="blog-item">
      <h2 class="sub-heading">How might you engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit?
      </h2>
      <p>
        For my own benefit, repetition is a key principle that I will engage with. Repeating new skills and
        discussing them with others to get a better understanding is how I learn and retain information. I need to be
        physically using new skills to understand them, instead of just having things explained to me over and over.
        Also, being able to transfer skills to real life problems. Problem solving is such a crucial skill to have, and
        being able to adapt and tackle multiple problems is something I hope to gain from this.

      <h2 class="sub-heading">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
      <p>
        For myself, I am always wanting to learn a new skill. I’m in the process of learning a language, and in my
        free time trying to learn an instrument as well. I’m constantly engaging with new challenges both mental and
        physical by exercising a lot too, but these are both for fun and for improvement. I’m finding that balance of
        both working on myself and improving, while enjoying it at the same time, so I can feel like I am taking a break
        from feeling stressed. Also, I ensure I don’t push so hard that I’m exhausted and try to get plenty of rest when
        I can.

      <p>I found the <a
          href="https://www.neuroskills.com/brain-injury/neuroplasticity/ten-principles-of-neuroplasticity/">ten
          principles of neuroplasticity</a> very useful when looking into this because it makes the topic so easy to
        grasp. Not only that but it provides the basic steps to take to improve your neuroplasticity in a simple way
        that anybody could do it.</p>

      <h2 class="intro">GROWTH MINDSET</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="blog-item">
      <h2 class="sub-heading">What is growth mindset, and why it is relevant?</h2>
      <p>
        Growth mindset is the belief that your abilities and the way you think can actually be developed and
        improved. As opposed to believing that qualities such as intelligence or talent are fixed and are set that way
        permanently, a growth mindset believes they are just the starting point, and have a chance to grow and develop
        to become so much greater. It’s like comparing raw talent vs dedication and hard work, where talent can only get
        you so far, but hard work can bring out much more potential.

      <h2 class="sub-heading">In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
      <p>
        Nothing so much has surprised me when looking into all of this, but it does help put in perspective why I
        have struggled learning some things in school and university in the past. It has helped me know how I can
        approach this course to ensure I take in as much as I can in the most effective way possible.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="blog-item">
      <h2 class="sub-heading">How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
      <p>
        I will be using growth mindset to remind myself when I find myself stuck, or confronted with a problem that I
        feel I cannot solve, that giving up and asking for the answer is not how to get through it. Believing that I can
        find the answer if I try different methods, and just sticking to it while trying not to stress out too much will
        be a major assist in this experience. It will also help me learn, and build confidence in the long run not just
        for this but for my career as well.
