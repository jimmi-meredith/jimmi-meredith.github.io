      <h2 class="sub-heading">When did you get blocked on a simple problem?</h2>
      <p>
        The better question would be when didn't I get stuck. I actually thought I nailed the ‘deBee’ challenge really
        quickly, but I missed the fact that the words that needed to be taken out were a mixture of capitalised and
        lowercase letters. Even though everything else I had done was correct, I hadn’t taken this into account. After
        doing a little bit of research and coming up with a couple of theories, I found that the easiest way was to just
        convert the words to all become lowercase myself, and then remove the words from there.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get to this solution I used a mixture of:
      </p>
      Trying Something<br>
      Reading error messages<br>
      Console.logging<br>
      Googling<br>
      <p>
        I didn’t get too frustrated in this situation, but it did strike me as an interesting problem which helped me
        get through it with a level head. And I learnt that even though I’m always told to think simple, I need to think
        even more simple. Sometimes the answer is just as easy as you might think.
      </p>

    <div class="blog-item">
      <h2 class="sub-heading">When did you solve a problem in an elegant way?</h2>
      <p>
        The capitalise challenge gave me a chance for this. I found a function called ‘substring()’ and it basically was
        able to tidy up a huge mess (that to be honest didn’t even get to a working stage). It allowed me to make
        changes to any word starting from a certain letter position. In this case, it made capitalising the first letter
        of each word very easy, and then changing the rest of the word from the second letter in it onwards back to
        lowercase.
      </p>
      <p>
        To find this handy tool I ended up using:
      </p>
      Trying Something<br>
      Reflection<br>
      Reading error messages<br>
      Console.logging<br>
      Googling<br>
      <p>
        During solving this I felt pretty on edge and confused about a lot, not realising these certain functions
        existed made my life a lot easier. And it helped me learn to keep exploring new options even if you have one
        that works. A lot of the time the work can be done a lot quicker and easier.

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Pseudocode</h2>
      <p>
        I haven’t really dabbled in practicing a lot of pseudocode as much as I should have, but I have no doubt that I
        will be using
        it a lot more in the future. I'm still getting used to the idea of it.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Trying Something</h2>
      <p>
        This is something I’m pretty familiar with. I do sometimes find it hard to find a place to start when trying
        different things, but once the ball starts rolling I can get into the rhythm of things a bit better.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Rubber Ducky Method</h2>
      <p>
        I love the rubber ducky method. For me, explaining something to others is a really helpful way of showing my
        understanding of a problem. If I can’t explain something properly then I immediately know that I need to look
        more into it, or ask for help.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Reading Error Messages</h2>
      <p>
        I use this quite a bit. I mean when you have a message telling you exactly what the error is, it’s best not to
        ignore it. It can easily help save time by pointing you in the right direction.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Console.logging</h2>
      <p>
        I’m quite a visual worker so console.logging is by far one of the most helpful problem-solving techniques there
        is for me. I can see a result straight away and check if everything is working the way I want it to.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Googling</h2>
      <p>
        I’d say without Google I probably wouldn’t be able to do this course. I use it every day looking for help, so
        I’d say my confidence with using it is pretty high.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Asking Your Peers For Help</h2>
      <p>
        I have no issue asking my peers for help, I actually reached out once for a problem I had, but before I got an
        answer I actually fixed the problem myself (and such a simple one as well).
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Asking Coaches For Help</h2>
      <p>
        I’ve reached out to my coach a few times. I’d love to be able to sit down and work on a problem myself until I
        get it right, but sometimes I get to a point where it becomes the issues of spending hours trying to work it
        out, or taking ten minutes to talk to somebody about it. My coach does a really good job of helping in a way
        that it’s still me finding the solution, they just gently push me in the right direction.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Improving Your Process With Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        Reflection has actually been pretty difficult for me. It’s just as new as everything else has been in this
        course so far so I’m still getting the hang of it. I’m not sure how much it has helped in terms of my
        problem-solving, but I think it has helped a little overall.
