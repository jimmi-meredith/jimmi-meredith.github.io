      <h2 class="sub-heading">What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the
        core learning?</h2>
      <p>One thing I have learned about myself, is that I tend to consider myself having a fixed mindset a lot of the
        time. Some projects I take on I don’t feel like this but I believe with programming I have struggled to pick up
        on a lot of the basics and it has caused me to feel a lot of frustration, and therefore causing myself to feel
        unsure a lot.<br>
        I’ve also learned that I believe my emotional intelligence is actually quite high, and that comes from previous
        jobs and just my personality in general. This actually puts my mind at ease quite a bit as I know that this is
        such an important factor when it comes to working and looking for jobs that this is one of the key points
        employers look for.<br>
        And a third thing would be that I know my strengths and weaknesses well, and I’m willing to work on them. I know
        that I’m not the best at picking up things like this but I am great at talking and working with others, so I
        have no fear of asking for help and admitting that I’m struggling. It has saved me a lot in foundations, and I’m
        sure it will throughout the rest of my journey in programming.

      <h2 class="sub-heading">What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?
      </h2>
      <p>
        They are all about how you are as a team player. You need to be able to have the skills to work well with
        people, and to be somebody that is easy and enjoyable to work with. Empathy will give you the ability to
        understand how others are feeling, and react appropriately to ensure the work is still able to be done without
        any unnecessary dramas. Self-awareness allows you to be aware of where you currently at in both your head and in
        your skills, and to be able to admit if you need help. Values is all about what you care about in a working
        environment. Do you like a happy team? Do you care more about quality or quantity? When it comes to learning and
        programming, it’s all about how you are willing to apply yourself and how willing you are to work as a great
        team member.

      <h2 class="sub-heading">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
        A lot of this learning has surprised me, but I’d say the biggest one was the whole fixed vs growth mindset
        study. It made me realise that there has been a lot of situations where I’ve gone to learn a new skill and given
        up earlier than I should have because I was so focused on believing I couldn’t do it. I’ve felt the same a few
        times during this foundations course but now I’m just so much more determined to stick to it (I mean I would
        have anyway) and prove that I can actually get something I find very difficult if I stick to it. It’s also made
        me more determined to continue working on other skills I have interest in like learning another language or
        playing the piano.

      <h2 class="sub-heading">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
        A lot of this was new territory for me. I’ve never really spent much time focusing on how the mind works, how
        we can improve our learning, or about the way we learn in general. So, spending a lot of time focusing on this
        was quite challenging for me, and a big part of that is because I would sometimes feel like I should spend more
        time practicing coding and improving my programming skills. Sometimes it felt like a distraction which was good,
        as it was a nice way to take a break from coding every now and then. But when the big core learning exercises
        took over it felt like I wasn’t using my time as well as I should be.

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core
        learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
      <p>
        I reckon it’s because when it comes to getting into programming, it can be really tough for a lot of people.
        It’s a pretty complicated skill to take on, and having the ability to shape your mind to assist you in any way
        you can is such a crucial benefit. And it also falls down to understanding the mind, both yours and others. If
        you can accurately read other people, you can work better with them and for them. The soft skills are just as,
        if not more important when it comes to being employed, as technical skills can be taught to anybody, but being
        somebody who is great to work with is a finite skill not everybody knows how to do.

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you
        have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
      <p>
        • Funnily enough I spoke about this in a previous answer. While I do kind of wish I could have focused more on
        programming, I don’t think it was a waste of time. I mainly think that because I struggled quite a bit with the
        programming side of things so I would have liked to have spent more time on improving my skills there, but the
        core section of foundations has been really interesting and has actually shaped my mind differently.<br>
        I’ve learnt a lot about how to think when times get tough, and how I can better a better employee in the eyes of
        employers, solely because of thinking about my behaviour, and the way I think. Plus it’s only the beginning now
        but these skills will become a lot more apparent as time goes on.
