    </div>
    <div class="blog-item">
      <h2 class="sub-heading">What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the
        core learning?</h2>
      <p>One thing I have learned about myself, is that I tend to consider myself having a fixed mindset a lot of the
        time. Some projects I take on I don’t feel like this but I believe with programming I have struggled to pick up
        on a lot of the basics and it has caused me to feel a lot of frustration, and therefore causing myself to feel
        unsure a lot.<br>
        I’ve also learned that I believe my emotional intelligence is actually quite high, and that comes from previous
        jobs and just my personality in general. This actually puts my mind at ease quite a bit as I know that this is
        such an important factor when it comes to working and looking for jobs that this is one of the key points
        employers look for.<br>
        And a third thing would be that I know my strengths and weaknesses well, and I’m willing to work on them. I know
        that I’m not the best at picking up things like this but I am great at talking and working with others, so I
        have no fear of asking for help and admitting that I’m struggling. It has saved me a lot in foundations, and I’m
        sure it will throughout the rest of my journey in programming.

    <div class="blog-item">
      <h2 class="sub-heading">What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?
      </h2>
      <p>
        They are all about how you are as a team player. You need to be able to have the skills to work well with
        people, and to be somebody that is easy and enjoyable to work with. Empathy will give you the ability to
        understand how others are feeling, and react appropriately to ensure the work is still able to be done without
        any unnecessary dramas. Self-awareness allows you to be aware of where you currently at in both your head and in
        your skills, and to be able to admit if you need help. Values is all about what you care about in a working
        environment. Do you like a happy team? Do you care more about quality or quantity? When it comes to learning and
        programming, it’s all about how you are willing to apply yourself and how willing you are to work as a great
        team member.

      <h2 class="sub-heading">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
        A lot of this learning has surprised me, but I’d say the biggest one was the whole fixed vs growth mindset
        study. It made me realise that there has been a lot of situations where I’ve gone to learn a new skill and given
        up earlier than I should have because I was so focused on believing I couldn’t do it. I’ve felt the same a few
        times during this foundations course but now I’m just so much more determined to stick to it (I mean I would
        have anyway) and prove that I can actually get something I find very difficult if I stick to it. It’s also made
        me more determined to continue working on other skills I have interest in like learning another language or
        playing the piano.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="blog-item">
      <h2 class="sub-heading">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
        A lot of this was new territory for me. I’ve never really spent much time focusing on how the mind works, how
        we can improve our learning, or about the way we learn in general. So, spending a lot of time focusing on this
        was quite challenging for me, and a big part of that is because I would sometimes feel like I should spend more
        time practicing coding and improving my programming skills. Sometimes it felt like a distraction which was good,
        as it was a nice way to take a break from coding every now and then. But when the big core learning exercises
        took over it felt like I wasn’t using my time as well as I should be.
      </p>

    <div class="blog-item">
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core
        learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
      <p>
        I reckon it’s because when it comes to getting into programming, it can be really tough for a lot of people.
        It’s a pretty complicated skill to take on, and having the ability to shape your mind to assist you in any way
        you can is such a crucial benefit. And it also falls down to understanding the mind, both yours and others. If
        you can accurately read other people, you can work better with them and for them. The soft skills are just as,
        if not more important when it comes to being employed, as technical skills can be taught to anybody, but being
        somebody who is great to work with is a finite skill not everybody knows how to do.

    <div class="blog-item">
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you
        have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
      <p>
        Funnily enough I spoke about this in a previous answer. While I do kind of wish I could have focused more on
        programming, I don’t think it was a waste of time. I mainly think that because I struggled quite a bit with the
        programming side of things so I would have liked to have spent more time on improving my skills there, but the
        core section of foundations has been really interesting and has actually shaped my mind differently.<br>
        I’ve learnt a lot about how to think when times get tough, and how I can better a better employee in the eyes of
        employers, solely because of thinking about my behaviour, and the way I think. Plus it’s only the beginning now
        but these skills will become a lot more apparent as time goes on.

      <h2 class="intro">CORE REFLECTIONS</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="blog-item">
      <h2 class="sub-heading">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>
        My pathway involves wanting to eventually move overseas and work in somewhere like Europe with my partner. I
        believe that having the skills I learn from Dev Academy will give me perfect opportunity to be able to find work
        anywhere in the world once I’m confident enough (Germany is a place we have in mind currently). I love the idea
        of working on websites and creating things that are pleasing for a user to use, so I definitely have interest in
        front-end development at the moment, but I will continue to keep all options open.

      <h2 class="sub-heading">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I think my initial thoughts from sprint two are pretty similar to what they are now. My main concern is that I
        haven’t picked up as many skills so far as I hoped I would. I want to be the best I can be coming in to
        bootcamp, so I need to put in a lot of extra miles when the time comes. I haven’t felt as many satisfying
        moments of completing challenges as I’d hoped because I had to ask for help a lot more often than I would have
        liked. In saying that, my strengths are still there because I still have the drive to do well, I just need to
        apply myself and not let myself or anybody else down.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="blog-item">
      <h2 class="sub-heading">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
      <p>
        In all honesty I don’t feel like I will have any major non-technical challenges at bootcamp. If I had to pick
        something though I would say time management might be a slight concern. My commute will take up two hours of
        each day, and then I want to try and fit in a gym session during the lunch break as well if possible, so it’s
        just about finding the balance of getting the necessary work in, but also giving myself time to have a mental
        break from all the stress.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="blog-item">
      <h2 class="sub-heading">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself
        while at EDA?</h2>
      <p>
        I’ve always said that I would like to develop some leadership skills over this course. Mostly now more than
        ever because my confidence is lacking a bit after my experience in foundations. But also because I’ve never
        really worked a job or been in a role that required many leadership qualities so it’s something I don’t have
        much experience in. I’m pretty confident in my ability to work in a team in general but taking charge especially
        in something that’s still pretty foreign to me will be pretty interesting.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="blog-item">
      <h2 class="sub-heading">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
      <p>
        I expect myself to take full advantage of the people around me. By having a room full of peers and staff
        around me all the time I want to never have a moment where I choose to not take advantage of learning from other
        people as much as teaching myself. I want to try and stay on campus as much as possible and make the most of my
        time, and to gain confidence to admit when I’m feeling really down. I also hope to act professional under the
        right circumstances. I come from working in radio where I could pretty much act like I was at home each day, so
        I expect myself to take this seriously when the time comes.
