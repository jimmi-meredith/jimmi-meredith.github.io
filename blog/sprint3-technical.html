      <h2 class="sub-heading">HTML vs CSS</h2>
      <p>Think of a house. The HTML is all of the base properties that the house needs. The walls, the doors, the
        windows, the roof, floor, and whatever else the house needs to be functional. The CSS would be how everything
        about the house looks. What colour the paint is, how tall the house is, where the doors are located, what the
        walls are made of, etc. Everything that affects the look and style of the house is done by the CSS.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="blog-item">
      <h2 class="sub-heading">CONTROL FLOW AND LOOPS</h2>
      <p>Let’s go inside the house and make some toast for breakfast. Control flow will help us determine what we will
        have on our toast. Our favourite flavour is peanut butter, so if that’s available we’ll have that. But we need
        some backup options if there isn’t any. Control flow will dictate what we have on our toast, depend on what is
        available in the cupboard.</p>
      <img id="tech-photo" class="resize" src="../Photos/ToastTree.png" alt="Decision Tree For Making Toast">
      <p>Here we have instructions that tell us if there is peanut butter, to make toast with that. If there isn’t any
        but there is marmite, we will have that instead. But in the unlucky event that we are lacking both
        ingredients, we’re going to suffer with plain crispy bread. Yum.</p>
      <p>
        With loops, we can choose to repeat the same set of instructions multiple times. There are three different
        ways we can do this, by using the ‘<span class="bold">for</span>,’ ‘<span class="bold">while</span>,’ and
        ‘<span class="bold">do… while</span>’ loops. Let’s take a look at how we want to approach eating some
        delicious cupcakes we happened to have spotted while making our toast.</p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">THE DOM</h2>
      <p>The DOM (or Document Object Model) is an interface which represents each component of the HTML document as an
        object. Which in turn, allows JavaScript (an object-orientated language) to manipulate and interact with
        everything within the document.<br>
        Each element in the DOM is referred to as a ‘node,’ and the model sees everything in the form of a tree diagram,
        seen in the (simplified) image below.
      </p>
      <img id="tech-photo" src="../Photos/html_dom_tree.png" alt="Two Boxes, One Without A Border">
      <p>An example of a way we can use JavaScript to access a node is through classes. If I wanted to change the
        background colour of each item that had the class 'heading,' I can find them all in JavaScript using
        <span class="bold">document.getElementsByClassName(‘heading’)</span> and choose to make my changes from there.
      </p>

    <div class="blog-item">
      <h2 class="sub-heading">ARRAYS AND OBJECTS</h2>
      <p>Arrays and objects are two different ways you can use variables to store multiple bits of information. The
        difference being that an array is a variable that contains a list of multiple data points, while objects are
        variables that contains multiple properties representing them.</p>
      <p>Look at the examples below.</p>
      <img id="tech-photo" src="../Photos/FaveFoodsArray.jpeg" alt="FaveFoods Array In JavaScript">
      <p>This is an array. Note: Within the square brackets there can be strings, numbers, objects, Booleans, and
        even other arrays. Arrays are accessed with zero-indexing, meaning that each element is numbered within the
        array starting from zero. So if I wanted to access ‘Burger‘ I would have to use <span
          class="bold">console.log(faveFoods[2])</span>.</p>
      <img id="tech-photo" src="../Photos/BurgerObject.jpeg" alt="Burger As An Object In JavaScript">
      <p>This is an object. Objects are different as you access the key for a property within the variable, done
        through either a dot, or bracket notation (though with a slight difference of one needing quotes and one
        not).<br>
        For example, both <span class="bold">console.log(myBurger.Sauce)</span> and <span
          class="bold">console.log(myBurger['Sauce'])</span> will return the property 'Peanut Satay.'</p>
    </div>
    <div class="blog-item">
      <h2 class="sub-heading">FUNCTIONS</h2>
      <p>Functions are a set of code that is used to perform a set of instructions. We create the code required for a
        certain task, then we can call that function to be used anytime throughout or code. This is extremely handy as
        it means we can write the function once and reuse it whenever we want or need to.<br>
        Here is an example of a function that determines if somebody would enjoy eating dessert after dinner.
      </p>
      <img id="tech-photo" src="../Photos/WantsDessertFunction.jpeg" alt="Two Boxes With Margin Set To 0">
      <p>If I enter my details into the function <span class="bold">wantsDessert(true, Jimmi)</span>, true being yes I
        absolutely feel like something sweet, and name being my name, then of course the function returns 'Hell yea
        Jimmi, treat yourself!'</p>
