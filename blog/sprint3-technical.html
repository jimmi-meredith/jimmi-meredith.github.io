      <h2 class="sub-heading">HTML vs CSS</h2>
      <p>Think of a house. The HTML is all of the base properties that the house needs. The walls, the doors, the
        windows, the roof, floor, and whatever else the house needs to be functional. The CSS would be how everything
        about the house looks. What colour the paint is, how tall the house is, where the doors are located, what the
        walls are made of, etc. Everything that affects the look and style of the house is done by the CSS.</p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">CONTROL FLOW AND LOOPS</h2>
      <p>Let’s go inside the house and make some toast for breakfast. Control flow will help us determine what we want
        on our toast. Our favourite flavour is peanut butter, so if that’s available we’ll have that. But we need some
        backup options if there isn’t any. Control flow will dictate what we have on our toast, depend on what is
        available in the cupboard.</p>
        <img id="tech-photo" class="resize" src="../Photos/ToastTree.png" alt="Decision Tree For Making Toast">
        <p>Here we have instructions that tell us if there is peanut butter, to make toast with that. If there isn’t any
          but there is marmite, we will have that instead. But in the unlucky event that we are lacking both
          ingredients, we’re going to suffer with plain crispy bread. Yum.</p>
        <p>
          With loops, we can choose to repeat the same set of instructions multiple times. There are three different
          ways we can do this, by using the ‘<span class="bold">for</span>,’ ‘<span class="bold">while</span>,’ and
          ‘<span class="bold">do… while</span>’ loops. Let’s take a look at how we want to approach eating those
          delicious cupcakes we spotted while making our toast.</p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">THE DOM</h2>
      <p>The DOM (or Document Object Model) is an interface which represents each component of the HTML document as an
        object. Which allows JavaScript (an object-orientated language) to manipulate and interact with everything
        within the document.<br>
        Each element in the DOM is referred to as a ‘node,’ and the model lays out everything as a tree diagram as seen
        in the (simplified) image below.
      </p>
      <img id="tech-photo" src="../Photos/Image 11-02-20 at 9.43 PM.jpeg" alt="Two Boxes, One Without A Border">
      <p>An example of a way we can use JavaScript to access a node is through classes. If I wanted to change the
        background colour of each item that had the class “heading,” I can find them all in JavaScript using
        document.getElementsByClassName(‘heading’) and choose to make my changes from there.</p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">ARRAYS AND OBJECTS</h2>
      <p>Arrays and objects are two different ways you can use variables to store multiple bits of information. The
        difference being that an array is a variable that contains a list of multiple data points, while objects are
        variables that contains multiple properties representing them.</p>
      <p>Look at the examples below.</p>
      <img id="tech-photo" src="../Photos/Image 12-02-20 at 8.29 AM.jpeg" alt="Two Boxes With Margin Set To 0">
      <p>This is an array. Note how within the square brackets there can be strings, numbers, objects, Booleans, and
        even other arrays. Arrays are accessed with zero-indexing, meaning that each element is numbered within the
        array starting from zero. So if I wanted to access ‘ ,‘ I would have to use <span
          class="bold">console.log(faveFoods[2])</span>.</p>
      <img id="tech-photo" src="../Photos/Image 12-02-20 at 8.18 AM.jpeg" alt="Box with Special Padding">
      <p>This is an object. Objects are different as you access the key for a property within the variable, done
        through either a dot, or bracket notation. For example </p>

    <div class="blog-item">
      <h2 class="sub-heading">ARRAYS AND OBJECTS</h2>
      <p>Functions are a set of code that is used to perform a set of instructions. We create the code required for a
        certain task, then we can call that function to be used anytime throughout or code. This is extremely handy as
        it means we can write the function once and reuse it whenever we want or need to.<br>
        Here is an example of a function that determines if somebody would enjoy eating dessert after dinner.

      <p>TIf I enter my details into the function wantsDessert(true, Jimmi) of course it obviously returns ‘What are you
        waiting for? Go smash some sweet goods.’</p>
