      <h2 class="sub-heading">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
      <p>Emotional Intelligence refers to how aware we are of our own and other’s emotions, and being able to use this
        information to guide our thinking and behaviour to our advantage. It’s the difference between noticing somebody
        is angry and leaving it at that, and analysing why they could be angry, and seeing if the anger is possibly a
        cover up for being sad for example. You can guide your thinking and behaviour to react in a more according way,
        rather than just take things as they appear.</p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">How is it different to IQ?</h2>
      <p>IQ is the measurement of how you learn. In particular it is generally used to gauge how well somebody can use
        information and logic to answer questions or make theories. Whereas emotional intelligence is more about dealing
        with the way people feel, and being able to control our stress levels, communicate with others better, and deal
        with challenges in a more appropriate way. Although these things are quite different, they do actually
        complement each other. The ability to have a high intelligence, and also be successful in maintain positive
        relationships both in and out of the workplace, means that there’s a pretty high chance that you will be
        successful in life.

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Why is it important?
      </h2>
      <p>Both IQ and EQ are important for different reasons. IQ is important because in the work place, being able to
        approach things with a mind of logic and understanding can help new challenges be overcome a lot easier. But EQ
        is arguably more important, as this is all about how well you work with others. The higher your EQ, the better
        your ability to communicate with team members, reflect on issues in a more beneficial manner, and create a
        better working environment for all those involved. It can also give you the skills you need to be a better
        leader if your goals are to progress into higher positions.</p>
