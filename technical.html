        <h2>The Basics</h2>
        <p>First things first, it’s important to know that all HTML elements are considered as boxes. And in CSS, this is referred to as the ‘box model’ when talking about design and layout. Let’s take a look at what a basic box model looks like.
        </p>
        <img id="box-model" src="Photos/Image 11-02-20 at 4.14 PM.jpeg" alt="Basic Box Model">
        <p>Using the above image as our guide, we can identify the four sections of our HTML box model.<br>
        </p> 
        <p>  
          We have:
        </p>
          <p><span class="bold">CONTENT</span> – The content of the box, generally where text and images appear<br>
            <span class="bold">PADDING</span> – The area between the content and the border of the box<br>
            <span class="bold">BORDER</span> – The border edge of the box<br>
            <span class="bold">MARGIN</span> – The area between the box’s border and any neighbouring elements
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="blog-item">
          <h2>PADDING</h2>
        <img id="padding-1" src="Photos/Image 11-02-20 at 4.02 PM.jpeg" alt="Two Yellow Boxes">
        <p>Looking at the image above, we can see some text in a yellow box, that has a black border. The difference between these two images is that the top one has a padding of 0 pixels, while the bottom one has a padding of 20 pixels. Notice how in the second box the space between the text and the border is much larger. This is because all around the content (the text) in the box, there is now 20 pixels of padding between it and the border.
        </p>
        <p>This can all be adjusted to specific sides as well if you wish to have a different amount of padding on different sides.
        </p>
        <p>For example:
        </p>
        <img src="Photos/Image 11-02-20 at 5.05 PM.jpeg" alt="Box with Special Padding">
        <p>The padding here has been modified so that there is 30px on the top, 70px on the right, 20px on the bottom, and 40px on the left. </p>
