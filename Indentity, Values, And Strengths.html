      <p>Explain a situation where you have had and ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of the action you took.</p>
      <p>I had a situation where I cut a really close friend out of my life because I thought their values were in the wrong place. 
      Now usually for me I tend to want to make everybody happy, so my usual stance would have been to take my friend’s side and help them feel better, but this was a unique situation where I just couldn’t do so.
      I thought about what was important to me here. I love to have good relationships with everybody as I am a people pleaser, but more important than that, is what I value about those relationships. Things like honesty, respect, and loyalty. I could see nothing about this friendship held these values from her end, and after this whole situation it made it more so clear. 
      After some thinking, I decided then and there to cut this person out of my life because I don’t need somebody who treated their friends the way they were treating myself and others as well. The consequence was of course that I lost a friendship that I really did enjoy, we were adventurous, spontaneous, and always wanting to do something fun which was awesome for me being in an unfamiliar town at the time, but I knew that there were no long-term benefits of having this person in my life. And afterwards things actually got better for everybody else involved, as they chose to do the same. Follow your gut as they say, and don’t keep people around you who spread toxicity. 
      For me this is the first time I had done something like this, because I always wanted to make people happy and have them like me. But this was where I realised that now that I’m older, making everybody happy isn’t important anymore, and I was really proud of myself for making such a big sacrifice at the time. I still am today.
