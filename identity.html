        <h2>Explain a situation where you have had and ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of the action you took</h2>
        <p>I had a situation where I cut a really close friend out of my life because I thought their values were in the wrong place.
          Now usually for me I tend to want to make everybody happy, so my usual stance would have been to take my friend’s side and help them feel better, but this was a unique situation where I just couldn’t do so. I thought about what was important to me here. I love to have good relationships with everybody as I am a people pleaser, but more important than that, is what I value about those relationships. Things like honesty, respect, and loyalty. After this situation, I could see nothing about this friendship held these values from their end. 
          After some thinking, I decided then and there to cut this person out of my life because I don’t need somebody who treated their friends the way they were treating myself and others as well. The consequence was of course that I lost a friendship that I really did enjoy, we were adventurous, spontaneous, and always wanting to do something fun which was awesome for me being in an unfamiliar town at the time, but I knew that there were no long-term benefits of having this person in my life. And afterwards things actually got better for everybody else involved, as they chose to do the same. Follow your gut as they say, and don’t keep people around you who spread toxicity. 
          For me this is the first time I had done something like this, because I always wanted to make people happy and have them like me. But this was where I realised that now that I’m older, making everybody happy isn’t important anymore, and I was really proud of myself for making such a big sacrifice at the time. I still am today.

        <h2>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</h2>
        <p>I would say I grew up in a typical New Zealand family, went to a pretty typical school, and made some classic kiwi friends. I say this because throughout my life I’ve been surrounded by the classic kiwi culture of being a New Zealander. After doing some thinking and talking with friends and family, I would strongly agree that all of this has shaped me into the person I am today, especially when it comes to my values, and my identity. One prime example of this is with the kiwi culture’s way of communication. Having spoken with a couple of people about this, we concluded that we are very well known for their acceptance of outsiders. Whether it be a stranger from down the road, or a foreigner from another country. We are great at passing time with somebody we’ve never spoken to before and can form a bond very quickly due to our friendly nature, and I see this in myself. I love meeting new people and embracing others. My close friend group of only a small amount of people contains people who come from vastly different cultures all over the world, and I love that. I love embracing new things and learning about other experiences from people’s lives. Even my partner is from Germany, and we have compared so many differences about our cultures which some would say isn’t a good fit sometimes, but I believe learning from our differences can make us both better people.
          Another part of my life that has impacted my identity a lot, is the kiwi ‘can do’ attitude. My friends, family and I have a very optimistic mindset when it comes to just about anything. Even in situations where things are looking pretty bad like your car is halfway across a river and you don’t think you’re going to make it. Instead of panicking we tend to look at each other and say ‘She’ll be right mate.’ This has greatly influenced my values in the workplace. Ask any boss I’ve worked for and they’ll tell you that I’ve always taken on any task given to me with a smile and said ‘sure thing.’ Granted sometimes I wish I hadn’t, but I want to prove that I am somebody you can rely on, when you need to. I like to take on challenges, and I like to make people happy in the process.

        <h2>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h2>
        <p>I’d say one of my strengths is the ability to get on with others, and work well in a team. For me I learn well from discussing with those who are more advanced than I am, and working hands on with them to help develop my skills and knowledge. I love working in a team and bouncing ideas off each other, and I always believe that a team can get much better results than working alone. In terms of my career and learning, I use think this course will benefit me great as it allows for just that. Working with classmates and teaching each other new things every day. I hope to form good relationships with anybody I meet in both school, and work to help me make the most out of this new industry.
          As for a limitation I have, just like teamwork being a benefit for me, I think being alone will slow me down a lot. I’m not saying I can’t work alone and do a good job, but when it comes to actually learning, that’s where I can struggle. I learn by communicating and doing, and with the first part of this course being mainly researching and teaching myself, I know I can easily get lost or confused when met with new material. Usually I consider myself a fast learner, but only under certain circumstances, and I am slightly concerned that because I find some of this stuff hard to understand at first, I’m going to fall behind my other cohort members.

        <h2>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles</h2>
        <p>In terms of my learning journey, I know that I want to learn. A big part of being a programmer is being able to problem solve, and that is just the sort of thing I love doing. I don’t like being handed the answer unless I really need it. When I’m stuck, it’s because I don’t understand something properly, and I don’t want to be given a step by step instruction manual of how to get what I want. I would much rather have somebody explain to me what each step actually does and why we’re doing it, so that I can apply that knowledge to all future projects. So, communication is what is extremely important here. I hope to be able to explain something simply to others will help me reach the stage of confidence I wish to be at.

        <h2>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why</h2>
        <p>In my last job I worked as an audio engineer in radio. Part of this job I got to create some really cool and fun projects. I worked with voice talent, creative writers, and musicians to make some awesome stuff. One of the things we made are your well-known annoying jingles.
          During this process we often had lots of resistance, and it would have come from so many different areas. The client doesn’t like the music, the writer doesn’t agree with the client, the message doesn’t fit the client’s business etc. the list goes on. 
          One particular time we had a situation where myself and the writer behind the jingle had two very different ideas on how the jingle should sound. We ended up getting into a couple of light arguments which slowed the whole process down, and backtracking a lot because one of us wouldn’t be happy with the other’s decision. 
          At the time, to get through it we decided to make multiple versions so we could send them all off and hear what the client thought. Although this worked at the time, I believe that it was still a waste of our production time and resources compared to other situations.
          If I was to do this again, I would try bringing another colleague to give in their input, or ask the client first for a better explanation of what they wanted (they had said but they were very vague). I also think it’s important to come to a compromise earlier on rather than continuing to have small debates all throughout the working process slowing everything down.
