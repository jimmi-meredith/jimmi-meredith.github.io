      <h2>Explain a situation where you have had and ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of the action you took</h2>
      <p>I had a situation where I cut a really close friend out of my life because I thought their values were in the wrong place. 
      Now usually for me I tend to want to make everybody happy, so my usual stance would have been to take my friend’s side and help them feel better, but this was a unique situation where I just couldn’t do so.
      I thought about what was important to me here. I love to have good relationships with everybody as I am a people pleaser, but more important than that, is what I value about those relationships. Things like honesty, respect, and loyalty. After this situation, I could see nothing about this friendship held these values from their end. 
      After some thinking, I decided then and there to cut this person out of my life because I don’t need somebody who treated their friends the way they were treating myself and others as well. The consequence was of course that I lost a friendship that I really did enjoy, we were adventurous, spontaneous, and always wanting to do something fun which was awesome for me being in an unfamiliar town at the time, but I knew that there were no long-term benefits of having this person in my life. And afterwards things actually got better for everybody else involved, as they chose to do the same. Follow your gut as they say, and don’t keep people around you who spread toxicity. 
      For me this is the first time I had done something like this, because I always wanted to make people happy and have them like me. But this was where I realised that now that I’m older, making everybody happy isn’t important anymore, and I was really proud of myself for making such a big sacrifice at the time. I still am today.

      <h2>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</h2>
      <p>I would say I grew up in a typical New Zealand family, went to a pretty typical school, and made some classic kiwi friends. I say this because throughout my life I’ve been surrounded by the classic kiwi culture of being a New Zealander. After doing some thinking and talking with friends and family, I would strongly agree that all of this has shaped me into the person I am today, especially when it comes to my values, and my identity. One prime example of this is with the kiwi culture’s way of communication. Having spoken with a couple of people about this, we concluded that we are very well known for their acceptance of outsiders. Whether it be a stranger from down the road, or a foreigner from another country. We are great at passing time with somebody we’ve never spoken to before and can form a bond very quickly due to our friendly nature, and I see this in myself. I love meeting new people and embracing others. My close friend group of only a small amount of people contains people who come from vastly different cultures all over the world, and I love that. I love embracing new things and learning about other experiences from people’s lives. Even my partner is from Germany, and we have compared so many differences about our cultures which some would say isn’t a good fit sometimes, but I believe learning from our differences can make us both better people.
        Another part of my life that has impacted my identity a lot, is the kiwi ‘can do’ attitude. My friends, family and I have a very optimistic mindset when it comes to just about anything. Even in situations where things are looking pretty bad like your car is halfway across a river and you don’t think you’re going to make it. Instead of panicking we tend to look at each other and say ‘She’ll be right mate.’ This has greatly influenced my values in the workplace. Ask any boss I’ve worked for and they’ll tell you that I’ve always taken on any task given to me with a smile and said ‘sure thing.’ Granted sometimes I wish I hadn’t, but I want to prove that I am somebody you can rely on, when you need to. I like to take on challenges, and I like to make people happy in the process.
